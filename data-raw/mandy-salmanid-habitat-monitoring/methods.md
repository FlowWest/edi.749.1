Data was collected following methods described at [this pdf](https://www.sacramentoriver.org/forum/publications/side_channels/Monitoring%20Plan%20(final)%20170831.pdf)

Monitoring efforts will generate data for the presented response variables for the purpose of test-ing the hypotheses presented in table 1 of the aforementioned document.  Specific response vari-able metrics are identified while methods reference field protocols that are documented in Ap-pendix A (Table A-1).

Note that the above referenced protocol includes additional types of data collection. Enclosure study, microhabitat use, seining, and snorkel study methods are identified and clearly labeled throughout the document.

Caveats to using this data:  Some enclosures lost fish due to mortality or escape, and others did not.  This resulted in different densities between habitat types, and confounded habitat type with density dependent effects on growth. Logistical constraints prevented removal of all enclosures on the same day, so the total time from start to finish was not identical between habitat types.
